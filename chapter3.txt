Soft winds gently hum,
Leaves whisper secrets to stars—
Night’s calm embraces.

Moonlight bathes the earth,
Dew clings to the sleeping grass,
Dreams drift on the breeze.

Owls call through the dark,
Echoes ripple through still woods,
Time slows in shadows.

Morning looms afar,
Hints of gold paint the sky’s edge—
Hope wakes with the dawn.
